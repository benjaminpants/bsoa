# Ben's Slightly Odd Additions
An UCP created for Beemod 2.4, or to more precise, built and designed for 4.36.1.
This pack is not tested for versions later then the one listed above.
# How to install
(NOTE: You can skip step 1 and 2 and just use your current version of Beemod!)
1. Install this custom build of Beemod 4.36.1 and install the base 4.36.1 packages (BSOA was made for 4.36.1 but should run on any other version just fine): https://drive.google.com/file/d/19N8HLJ7h9B23noyEOGaynip9zcDBCNsR/view?usp=sharing
2. Download the latest release, NOT the download code button.
3. Copy zip folder to: `your-BEE2-folder/packages`
4. Done!
